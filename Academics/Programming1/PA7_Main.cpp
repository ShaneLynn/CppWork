---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Description:
 This program is a calculator to determine the area for a circle, rectangle, triangle, trapezoid, and sphere.  The
 program will display a menu to the user with 6 options, validate input, and use that input to branch into the item the user wants to calculate.
 Once in one of the branches, the program will ask the user for input based on the type of shape selected and then calculate the area of that shpare.
 One of the six options will be to exit the program. The program will terminate if any invalid inputs (negative numbers) are made.

*	The calculations in the program are based on the following data:
		-PI is 3.14159
		-User determines the menu choice and formula variables
*		-Circle area = PI * r2
		-Rectangle area = length * width
		-Triangle area = base * height * 0.5
		-Trapezoid area = height/2 * (b1 +b2)
		-Sphere area = 4 * PI *r2
â€¢	
	This program should display the following menu:
		Calculator Options:
		1.	Calculate the area of a circle
		2.	Calculate the area of a rectangle
		3.	Calculate the area of a triangle
		4.	Calculate the area of a trapezoid
		5.	Calculate the area of a sphere
		6.	Exit Enter your choice (1-6)
*
